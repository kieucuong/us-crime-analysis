[1] Total population change includes a residual. This residual represents the change in population that cannot be attributed to any specific demographic component. See Population Estimates Terms and Definitions at  http://www.census.gov/popest/about/terms.html.

[2] Net international migration (except for Puerto Rico) includes the international migration of 
both native and foreign-born populations. Specifically, it includes: (a) the net international 
migration of the foreign born, (b) the net migration between the United States and Puerto Rico, 
(c) the net migration of natives to and from the United States, and (d) the net movement of the 
Armed Forces population between the United States and overseas. Net international migration for 
Puerto Rico includes only the international migration of native and foreign-born populations 
between the United States and Puerto Rico.


Note: The April 1, 2010 population in this table is the Population Estimates base, which reflects 
changes to the Census 2010 population from geographic program revisions. See Geographic Terms and 
Definitions at

in each region and division. For population estimates methodology statements, see
