(X) Not applicable.


[1] Total population change includes a residual. This residual represents the change in 
population that cannot be attributed to any specific demographic component. See Population 
Estimates Terms and Definitions at  
http://www.census.gov/popest/about/terms.html.


[2] Net international migration (except for Puerto Rico) includes the international migration of 
both native and foreign-born populations. Specifically, it includes: (a) the net international 
migration of the foreign born, (b) the net migration between the United States and Puerto Rico, 
(c) the net migration of natives to and from the United States, and (d) the net movement of the 
Armed Forces population between the United States and overseas. Net international migration for 
Puerto Rico includes only the international migration of native and foreign-born populations 
between the United States and Puerto Rico.


Note: The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010 
population due to the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions. See Geographic Terms and Definitions at 
 
http://www.census.gov/popest/about/geo/terms.html for a list of the states that are included 
in each region and division. For population estimates methodology statements, see
